**Never reset or drop the database unless you are in a disposable test environment.**

**MAKE SURE WE ALWAYS HAVE Rails 8.0 Version Compatibility**

**Always resolve migration locks by closing other sessions, not by resetting.**


**NEVER ADD FIELDS OR CHANGES TO ANY TABLE OR DATABASE WITHOUT ASKING AND COMING WITH A GOOD DESIGN DECSIPON FOR THIS CHANGE AS YOUR ARGUMENT TO PROCEED**

**Rails 8 changed how enums are defined. Use the Correct Rails 8 Syntax

WRONG: enum :status, { pending: 0, success: 1, failed: 2 }
RIGHT: enum status: { pending: 0, success: 1, failed: 2 }**

**Always check response.body.nil? || response.body.empty? instead of response.nil? when using HTTParty**


- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules
