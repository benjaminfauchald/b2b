Key Highlights:
🔴 Mandatory TDD Workflow: Red-Green-Refactor cycle with tests written first
📋 Pre-Development Planning: Structured planning template for every feature

** PLEASE CONTINUE UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED THE TASK **

** ANY CHANGES TO DATABASE MUST COME WITH A FULL MIGRATION PLAN AS THE LAST STEP** FINISH EVERY REASONING FIRST AND NO AD HOC CHANGES TO DATABASE STRUCTURE! **

🏗️ Strict Rails Conventions: All naming, file structure, and architectural patterns
🧪 Comprehensive Testing Strategy: Model, controller, integration, and system test approaches
🔧 Service Control Table Integration: Aligned with your SCT logging requirements
Core Principles:

Convention Over Configuration: Strict adherence to Rails naming and structural conventions
Test-Driven Development: Always write tests first, then minimal code to pass
Atomic Development: Plan → Test → Code → Refactor → Commit workflow
Quality Assurance: Rubocop integration, security best practices, proper error handling

The rules include specific templates for:

Feature planning and test strategy documentation
RSpec test structure and naming conventions
Factory Bot usage patterns
Database migration and indexing standards
Controller and model testing strategies
Integration with your existing SCT system

This ensures every Rails project follows best practices while maintaining consistency with your existing database logging architecture. The rules are designed to work seamlessly with Cursor's AI assistance while enforcing the disciplined approach of writing tests before implementation.
