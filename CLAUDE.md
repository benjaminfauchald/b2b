- `./bin/rake dev:stop` - Stop all development services
- `./bin/rake dev:status` - Check status of development services
- `./bin/rake restart` - Restart only Rails server (kills old processes and starts fresh)
- `./bin/rake kill` - Kill any Rails server running on port 3000
- `./bin/rails console` - Open Rails console
