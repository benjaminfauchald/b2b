## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have identified a potential security vulnerability in our projects, we encourage you to report it immediately. We take all reports of security issues seriously and will work diligently to address them.

To report a vulnerability, please send an email directly to contact@karafka.io.

We understand the importance of addressing security vulnerabilities promptly. You can expect a reply from us within 2 working days of your report. This initial response will confirm receipt of your report.

After acknowledging your report, we will:

- Evaluate the reported vulnerability in the context of our project.
- Provide you with regular updates on our progress.
- Upon completing our assessment, we will inform you of the outcome. This includes whether the vulnerability will be accepted or declined for further action.

Your report will be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties without your consent, except as required by law.

We appreciate your assistance in keeping our projects and their users safe by responsibly reporting vulnerabilities. Together, we can maintain a high standard of security for our community.
